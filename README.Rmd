```

This repository contains a small example of a plumber API which can takes an Excel file via POST request, then reads that file and returns it as plain text. 

There are 4 R scripts in this repository.

* `plumber.R` defines the plumber API
* `activate.R` starts the micro-service on the local host
* `post_excel.R` contains a function definition to POST files and return a tibble
* `example.R` will start the plumber service, load the `post_excel()` function, and run it on the `test.xls` file included in the repository (contains American Community Survey data)
